      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose/Elevator Pitch</h3>
      <p>Are you starting a new business, or are you self-employed? Would you like to reach more people through a 
        web page but do not know how to go about it? Or maybe you have a page that is not working well, and you have
        spent too much of your precious time on it. That's what I do. Depending on your needs, I will design and create 
        a user-friendly web page and give you suggestions on promoting your business through a web page.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience consists of Entrepreneurs, young and old, and corportions of all sizes. The problems with
        generalization are that that would consist of anyone interested in getting into the world wide web and 
        neglecting the pinpointed area for which one would be looking for a designer. Therefore, I would need to 
        show versatility. Many children nowadays, have been successful in creating thier own companies. They 
        may want to take their business to another level by adding an online presence. Then there are 
        a variety of companies that may need to revise the current design or begin creating a web page. these 
        are some scenarios of the targeted audience.

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.

      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Joan, or "Nuosu SIL", or "Gentium Plus"; <!-- change this -->

      </h4>
      <h3>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p>
       I picked Joan for my header font because it is easy to read, has serifs, and has curvature characteristics.
       I like how it looks with the words, 'Zander Web Design'.<br> 
       I picked Roboto for my paragraph text because there are no serifs, it is easy to read, it is simple, and I like it.

        the requirements are to use one picture of the speaker, character and paragraph styles, page numbers, a minimum of three colors, grids, margins,
        gutters, etc. We wer also to keep in mind who our audience would be. I chose my family as my audience. These mockups cam from freepik.com as a free
