    <p>I am working towards a bachelor’s degree in applied technology. I have wanted to learn web design for many years,
        and I am now pursuing that path. I plan on using this degree to help people create beautifully designed 
        web pages. I love that BYU-Idaho includes gospel-centered learning within the format of secular education.
    </p>

    <p>I am married to a wonderful man, and I have four children and one grandchild. I love hanging out with my 
        family and playing games. Our new favorite game is Dominion. We have other games we play as well. I love the 
        beauty of the earth and enjoy spending time outdoors.

     <p> I was born into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, but I was a converted member around age 24.
        One of my favorite scriptures is Alma 26:12, which says, "Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I 
        am weak; therefore, I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can
        I can do all things.".
